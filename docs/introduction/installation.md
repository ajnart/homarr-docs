Homarr can be installed in many ways. For most users, [Installation using Docker](#-installation-using-docker) will be sufficient and the easiest.

---

## Installation using Docker

Docker is a free Software that isolates Homarr using containers. Using Docker, you can run Homarr on any supported platform (including Windows and Raspberry Pi), easily.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

To install Homarr using Docker, simply run the following command.

```bash
docker run  \
  --name homarr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 7575:7575 \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/configs:/app/data/configs \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/icons:/app/public/icons \
  -d ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
```

:::note

Docker will mount the configuration files and icons to your host machine. Please make sure to replace ``<your-path>`` from the docker run command with your desired storage location. The path must be absolute.

:::

### Updating
To update Homarr, you must remove your container first. Make sure that you've mounted your data and that you have access to it, so your configuration doesn't get lost.

1. Run ``docker rm homarr`` to remove the container.
2. Pull the latest Homarr image ``docker pull ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest``.
3. Re-run the command you used to install Homarr.

This process can get tideous, if you update frequently. Thus, we recommend [the installation using docker-compose](#-installation-using-docker-compose-or-portainer) for more experienced users.

:::tip

Want to update all your containers automatically? Checkout [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) a service which will automatically update your containers on a set interval.

## Installation using Docker Compose or Portainer Stacks

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or [Portainer Stacks](https://www.portainer.io/blog/stacks-docker-compose-the-portainer-way)

### Installing

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Docker Compose">

To install Homarr using Docker Compose, simply create a file called ``docker-compose.yml`` and paste the following code into it.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.     #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./homarr/configs:/app/data/configs
      - ./homarr/icons:/app/public/icons
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

Then, run ``docker-compose up -d`` in the same directory. This will start the Homarr container in the background.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="portainer" label="Portainer Stacks">

To install Homarr using Portainer Stacks, simply create a new stack and paste the following code into it.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.     #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - <your-path>:/app/data/configs
      - <your-path>:/app/public/icons
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```


:::note

Portainer will mount the configuration files and icons to your host machine. Please make sure to replace ``<your-path>`` from the docker run command with your desired storage location. The path must be absolute.

:::

Then, click on ``Deploy the stack`` and wait until the container has started.

:::tip

If you're unsure how to create a stack, checkout the [Portainer Documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks/add).

:::

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Updating

To update Homarr using Docker Compose or Portainer Stacks, simply pull the latest image and restart the container.

1. Run ``docker pull ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest`` to pull the latest image.
2. Re-run ``docker-compose up -d`` or re-deploy the stack in Portainer.
