Homarr can be installed in many ways. For most users, [Installation using Docker](#-installation-using-docker) will be sufficient and the easiest.

---

## Installation using Docker

Docker is a free Software that isolates Homarr using containers. Using Docker, you can run Homarr on any supported platform (including Windows and Raspberry Pi), easily.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installation

To install Homarr using Docker, simply run the following command.

```bash
docker run  \
  --name homarr \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 7575:7575 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/configs:/app/data/configs \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/data:/data \
  -v <your-path>/homarr/icons:/app/public/icons \
  -d ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
```

:::note

Docker will mount the configuration files and icons to your host machine. Please make sure to replace ``<your-path>`` from the docker run command with your desired storage location. The path must be absolute.

:::

:::caution

Make sure all your volumes path are pointing at different folders or the mounting will fail.
Example of what NOT to do:
```bash
-v apps/homarr:/app/data/configs \
-v apps/homarr:/app/public/icons \
-v apps/homarr:/data
```

Instead do:
```bash
-v apps/homarr/configs:/app/data/configs \
-v apps/homarr/icons:/app/public/icons \
-v apps/homarr/data:/data
```

:::

### Updating
To update Homarr, you must remove your container first. Make sure that you've mounted your data and that you have access to it, so your configuration doesn't get lost.

1. Run ``docker rm homarr`` to remove the container.
2. Pull the latest Homarr image ``docker pull ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest``.
3. Re-run the command you used to install Homarr.

This process can get tideous, if you update frequently. Thus, we recommend [the installation using docker-compose](#-installation-using-docker-compose-or-portainer) for more experienced users.

:::tip

Want to update all your containers automatically? Checkout [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) a service which will automatically update your containers on a set interval.

## Installation using Docker Compose or Portainer Stacks

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) or [Portainer Stacks](https://www.portainer.io/blog/stacks-docker-compose-the-portainer-way)

### Installing

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="compose" label="Docker Compose">

To install Homarr using Docker Compose, simply create a file called ``docker-compose.yml`` and paste the following code into it.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.     #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Optional, only if you want docker integration
      - ./homarr/configs:/app/data/configs
      - ./homarr/icons:/app/public/icons
      - ./homarr/data:/data
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```

Then, run ``docker-compose up -d`` in the same directory. This will start the Homarr container in the background.

:::caution

Docker compose creates a network by default. Some integrations may not work (specifically Dash.) when the network internal hostname is used since clients do not know this name. It is recommended that you either use a local network wide hostname or the IP directly. An alternative is to create a DNS record with the same internal compose stack hostname for all clients outside.

:::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="portainer" label="Portainer Stacks">

To install Homarr using Portainer Stacks, simply create a new stack and paste the following code into it.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
version: '3'
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#     Homarr - A simple, yet powerful dashboard for your server.     #
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
services:
  homarr:
    container_name: homarr
    image: ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock # Optional, only if you want docker integration
      - <your-path>/configs:/app/data/configs
      - <your-path>/icons:/app/public/icons
      - <your-path>/data:/data
    ports:
      - '7575:7575'
```


:::note

Portainer will mount the configuration files and icons to your host machine. Please make sure to replace ``<your-path>`` from the docker run command with your desired storage location. The path must be absolute.

:::

:::caution

Make sure all your volumes path are pointing at different folders or the mounting will fail.

:::

Then, click on ``Deploy the stack`` and wait until the container has started.

:::tip

If you're unsure how to create a stack, checkout the [Portainer Documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/stacks/add).

:::

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Updating

To update Homarr using Docker Compose or Portainer Stacks, simply pull the latest image and restart the container.

1. Run ``docker pull ghcr.io/ajnart/homarr:latest`` to pull the latest image.
2. Re-run ``docker-compose up -d`` or re-deploy the stack in Portainer.

## Installation on Synology
The installation process is quite easy and fast on Synology devices.
Since this method is used less often, we recommend you to follow this guide written by mariushosting.

https://mariushosting.com/how-to-install-homarr-on-your-synology-nas/

:::note

This is a third party guide! It might not be up-to-date, nor do we offer official support.

---

## Installation on QNAP
When installing on QNAP, we recommend you to install Homarr using [Container Station]( https://www.qnap.com/en/software/container-station) or [this third-party image](https://www.myqnap.org/product/homarr/).

There is also a guide available, but note that it is written in Chinese: https://post.smzdm.com/p/awzm7op2/

:::caution

This is a *unvalidated* third party guide! It might not be up-to-date, nor do we offer official support.

:::

## Installation using Saltbox
You can also use this to install on Saltbox:
```bash
sb install sandbox-homarr
```

:::caution

This is a *unvalidated* third party guide! It might not be up-to-date, nor do we offer official support.

:::

---

## Installation on TrueNas Scale
Although Homarr is available from the Official TrueNas Scale Catalog, we recommend using the Truecharts catalog instead as they update to the latest release faster and offer more customization.

![](img/truenas-scale-integration.webp)

It is also recommended to make the volumes in there into HostPaths so you can access the folders easily.

:::caution

Don't use the same final destination folder twice as this will cause problems.

:::

## Building from source
:::info

Installing Homarr from source is not recommended and only intended for developers and contributors, please use the [Docker](#installation-using-docker) installation method instead.

## Installation using Helm


Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, easing deployment of applications like Homarr. The Helm chart for Homarr simplifies its deployment on any supported platform by Kubernetes, enabling efficient scaling and management.

### Prerequisites

- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

### Installation

To install Homarr using Helm chart, please follow this steps.

#### Add repository

```bash
helm repo add homarr https://oben01.github.io/dmz-charts/charts/homarr
```

#### Update repository

```bash
helm repo update
```

#### Install the chart

```bash
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART] --namespace [NAMESPACE] --create-namespace
```

For these commands, you should replace the placeholders accordingly:

- `[RELEASE_NAME]` - The name of your release.
- `[CHART]` - The name of your chart.
- `[NAMESPACE]` - The namespace where you want to deploy the chart.

#### Example using override values :

```bash
helm install homarr homarr/homarr --namespace homarr --create-namespace --values=override.yaml
```

```yaml
image:
# Overrides the image tag whose default is the chart appVersion.
  tag: "0.14.0"
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: traefik
hosts:
  - host: homarr.homelab.dev
    paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
  - host: www.homarr.homelab.dev
    paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
tls:
  - hosts:
    - "homarr.homelab.dev"
    - "www.homarr.homelab.dev"
  secretName: homelab-tls
```
All available values are listed on the [artifacthub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/homarr/homarr). If you find any issue please open an issue on [github](https://github.com/oben01/dmz-charts/issues/new)
