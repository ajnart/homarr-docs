# ⚙️ Prerequisites
## Architecture

We build Homarr for a bunch of different architectures, including ARM. Please ensure that your device architecture is supported by Homarr. We won't be able to provide support for unusual or outdated architectures.

| Architecture | Supported |
| ------------ | --------- |
| linux/amd64  | ✅        |
| linux/arm/v7 | ✅        |
| linux/arm64  | ✅        |

## Hardware
We recommend at least 500 MB memory and sufficient disk space. If you're running out of disk space, your configuration might get corrupted and some data might get permanently lost.
