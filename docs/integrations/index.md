:::caution

Homarr usually does not suport ``beta``, ``alpha`` or older legacy versions of integrations, because new versions often contain breaking API changes.
We will not support these, because the underyling API often changes frequently and would require much attention for very little outcome.

## Media Servers
Homarr can integrate with your media servers for better control over what's going on.

:::tip

Note, that we recommend you to create seperate accounts for better security.
Only grant access to the libraries, that must be accessed by Homarr, and remove unnessesary permissions.

Since all media servers do not expose the same information, Homarr might be unable to display certain information for servers.

:::

You may add multiple media servers, also of different kinds, to your dashboard.

### Initial setup
#### Installation of Media Server
The Overseer integration supports both Overseer and Jellyseer, a fork of Overseer compatible with Jellyfin.

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Install Plex on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">https://www.plex.tv/</a><br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Install Jellyfin on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html">https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html</a><br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Installation of Media requester

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      After you have your Plex instance up and running, you must install Overseer as your media request application. Please read the official documentation of how to install Overseerr on your machine: <a href="https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation">https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation</a>.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Oficially, Jellyfin is not supported by Overseerr. This is why Jellyfin users must use a fork of the official Overseerr project, which was modified to work with Jellyfin: <a href="https://github.com/bignuto/jellyseer">https://github.com/bignuto/jellyseer</a>.<br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Add your application in Homarr
If your instance of Overseerr or Jellyseerr is up and running, it's time to add it to your dashboard.
Simply select the correct type from the integration tab when editing the application:

![](img/overseerr/add-application.png)

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Select <code>Overseerr</code> in the app type for your Overseerr app.<br/>
      Fill our the field <code>Api token</code> with from the link below, when having <code>Overseerr</code> as the app type selected.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">

      Select <code>Jellyseerr</code> in the app type for your Jellyseer app.<br/>
      Fill our the field <code>Api token</code> with from the link below, when having <code>Jellyseerr</code> as the app type selected.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Searching for a movie / series

Then, type ``!os`` (with a space at the end) and enter, what you want to search for.

The integration will display, what content is already available in your media library.

## Docker

Homarr allows you to interact with Docker containers running on your system.

You can **restart**, **stop**, **start**, **refresh** and **remove** containers as well as **add** them to the Homarr dashboard

![Docker Core Features](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/190136/180496007-8456e486-a864-4510-b91f-fabf74df020c.png)

Additonally, if you have a lot of containers you can search and filter them by **container** or **image** name

![Contailer and Image Search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/190136/180496391-12a9a1c6-a54b-4d22-98ea-a5eb3a93fce4.png)

View the state of each container (**created**, **running** or **stopped**)

![Container States](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/190136/180598244-61c1db95-ed04-48c9-9577-2bd5ebff3ae9.png)

And also check what ports the container has exposed (container port:external port)

![Exposed Ports](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/190136/180598308-b24c7e83-e278-4556-a177-143fdd347f28.png)


### Before you begin
In order for Homarr to be able to interact with your Docker instance you must tell Homarr the path to your Docker socket.  You do this by adding the following to the Docker command when you first run Homarr:

`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

If you are running Docker Desktop on Windows 10, use the following path to your Docker socket:

`-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
