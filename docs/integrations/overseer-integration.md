# ðŸ‘€ Overseerr

The [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/) integration will enable you to request movies and series directly from your Homarr dashboard.

After choosing the correct type, you can search for content:

It displays, which content is already in your Overseerr library and links availble content directly to your [Plex](https://www.plex.tv/) or [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) instance.

## Initial setup
### Installation of Media Server
The Overseer integration supports both Overseer and Jellyseer, a fork of Overseer compatible with Jellyfin.

### Installation of Media requester

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="ðŸŽ¬ Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      After you have your Plex instance up and running, you must install Overseer as your media request application. Please read the official documentation of how to install Overseerr on your machine: <a href="https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation">https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation</a>.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="ðŸŽ¬ Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Oficially, Jellyfin is not supported by Overseerr. This is why Jellyfin users must use a fork of the official Overseerr project, which was modified to work with Jellyfin: <a href="https://github.com/bignuto/jellyseer">https://github.com/bignuto/jellyseer</a>.<br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
