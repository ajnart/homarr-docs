:::caution

Homarr usually does not support ``beta``, ``alpha`` or older legacy versions of integrations, because new versions often contain breaking API changes.
We will not support these, because the underlying API often changes frequently and would require much attention for very little outcome.

### Initial setup
#### Installation of Media Server
The Overseer integration supports both Overseerr and Jellyseerr, a fork of Overseerr compatible with Jellyfin.

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="🎬 Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Install Plex on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://www.plex.tv/">https://www.plex.tv/</a><br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="🎬 Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Install Jellyfin on your machine using your preferred installation method: <a href="https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html">https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/administration/installing.html</a><br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Installation of Media requester

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="🎬 Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      After you have your Plex instance up and running, you must install Overseer as your media request application. Please read the official documentation of how to install Overseerr on your machine: <a href="https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation">https://docs.overseerr.dev/getting-started/installation</a>.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="jellyfin" label="🎬 Jellyfin Media Server">
    <p>
      Officially, Jellyfin is not supported by Overseerr. This is why Jellyfin users must use a fork of the official Overseerr project, which was modified to work with Jellyfin: <a href="https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr">https://github.com/Fallenbagel/jellyseerr</a>.<br/>
      We recommend the installation using Docker for the easiest and fastest installation.
    </p>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Add your application in Homarr
If your instance of Overseerr or Jellyseerr is up and running, it's time to add it to your dashboard.
Simply select the correct type from the integration tab when editing the application:

![](img/overseerr/add-application.webp)

<Tabs groupId="media-server">
  <TabItem value="plex" label="🎬 Plex Media Server">
    <p>
      Select <code>Overseerr</code> in the app type for your Overseerr app.<br/>
      Fill our the field <code>Api token</code> with from the link below, when having <code>Overseerr</code> as the app type selected.
    </p>
  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, type ``!os`` (with a space at the end) and enter, what you want to search for.

The integration will display, what content is already available in your media library.

## Docker

Homarr allows you to interact with Docker containers running on your system.

You can **restart**, **stop**, **start**, **refresh** and **remove** containers as well as **add** them to the Homarr dashboard

![Docker Core Features](img/docker-core-features.png)

Additionally, if you have a lot of containers you can search and filter them by **container** or **image** name

![Container and Image Search](img/container-and-image-search.png)

View the state of each container (**created**, **running** or **stopped**)

![Container States](img/container-states.png)

And also check what ports the container has exposed (container port:external port)

![Exposed Ports](img/exposed-ports.png)


### Before you begin
In order for Homarr to be able to interact with your Docker instance you must tell Homarr the path to your Docker socket.  You do this by adding the following to the Docker command when you first run Homarr:

`-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`

If you are running Docker Desktop on Windows 10, use the following path to your Docker socket:

`-v //var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`
