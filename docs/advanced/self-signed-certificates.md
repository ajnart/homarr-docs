# Proxies and Certificates



## Allowing self signed certificates
Some users may come across a barrier, where they're unable to receive a 200 response from the Ping widget for some apps, while using self-signed certificates or a local certificate authory.

:::note What's going on?

Homarr is trying to communicate to your apps via the integrations.
It usually doesn't matter if Homarr is running on ``http`` or ``https``.
Your apps have a self-signed certificate - Homarr will recognize that the certificate was signed by an unknown authority and requests will be blocked.

:::

Sadly, you can't add your self-signed certificates to Homarr yet.
But you can deactivate the rejection for unauthorizes TLS requests.
Simply add the ``NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`` environment variable and set it to ``0``.
