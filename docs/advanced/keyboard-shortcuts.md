Homarr has the following keyboard shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `CTRL` + `K` | Opens the search bar |
| `CTRL` + `J` | Toggles Dark Mode |

:::note

The focus of your browser must be set on Homarr. If you click outside of Homarr, you might need to click once somewhere in Homarr to send all keystrokes again to Homarr.

If the shortcuts are not working, ensure that you have selected the correct keyboard layout.
