The Dash. widget will integrate your existing Dash. instance into Homarr. The graphs will be integrated using [iframe](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).
Additionally, you can enable or disable certain graphs, or enable the Multi-Core view for the CPU.

## Adding the widget
Please check out our documentation on [how to add a widget](/docs/introduction/after-the-installation#adding-widgets).

:::tip

If you want to quickly test the widget, before installing Dash. on your machine, we recommend to use the public demo server of Dash.
`https://dash.mauz.io/`

## Reverse Proxy Configuration
Homarr will embed the graphs of your Dash. instance.
Because of this, some users may experience problems, if they serve their Dash. instance using a reverse proxy.
While there are multiple reasons for this, the most common by far is that the reverse proxy is blocking access to Dash. using [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

Depending on which reverse proxy you're using, you must configure them differently to allow access via iframes.
Please note that iframes can be considered dangerous under some circumstances - we recommend you to read this answer on Stackoverflow entirely for understanding the risks involved with iframes (especially when you expose via a public domain): https://stackoverflow.com/a/9428051/15257712

If you want to proceed, you must configure this header on your reverse proxy: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options. Generally, in most cases you want to use ``SAMEORIGIN``. ``ALLOW-FROM <uri>`` is obsolete and no longer works in most browsers.
